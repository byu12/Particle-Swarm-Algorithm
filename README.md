# Particle-Swarm-Algorithm
The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart, is based on the social behavior exhibited by animals such as birds or fish when they are working as a group to reach a destination. The algorithm can be used to find the global minimum or maximun of different types of functions. This project will create a PSO implementation to solve the Ackley Function.

Command to run the program:
sh call_pso.sh <num_iteration> <num_particle> <w> <c1> <c2>
